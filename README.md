# Exchange Crypto Service API

A API for cryptocurrency exchange operations, built in Go, following Clean Architecture principles with integrated observability.

## Tech Stack
- **Go** (>=1.24)
- **PostgreSQL** (data persistence)
- **Liquibase** (database migration)
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (containerization and orchestration)
- **OpenTelemetry** (tracing and observability)
- **JWT Authentication** (secure token-based authentication)
- **Rate Limiting** (DDoS protection and traffic control)
- **Mockery** (mock generation for testing)
- **golangci-lint** (code linting and static analysis)
- **Makefile** (command automation)

## Quick Start

### Using Makefile
```bash
# Run application locally (starts containers + API)
make run-local

# Run complete application via Docker
make run-docker

# Fresh start (rebuild containers and run migrations)
make fs

# Build containers
make build

# Run database migrations
make migrate

# Run tests
make test

# Run code linting
make lint-code

# Stop all services
make down

# Show help with available commands
make help
```

## üê≥ Docker

This application is fully containerized using Docker Compose. You can run the entire stack (API + dependencies) with a single command.

### Quick Docker Commands
```bash
# Start everything via Docker
make run-docker

# View logs and manage containers
make logs
make status
make restart
```

**üìã For detailed Docker documentation, see [Docker Guide](./docs/DOCKER.md)**

## Project Structure
- `cmd/api/main.go`: application entry point
- `internal/app`: business modules (account, exchange, transaction, user)
- `internal/config`: configurations
- `internal/database`: database connection
- `liquibase/`: database scripts and migrations
- `docker-compose.yml`: services orchestration
- `Makefile`: automated commands

## Configuration
- Environment variables can be defined in `env.yaml`

## Database
- PostgreSQL is used as the main database
- Automatic migrations via Liquibase (`liquibase/changelog/migrations/*.sql`)
